\subsection{Stefan–Boltzmann equation}
The Stefan–Boltzmann equation applied to a black body gives the value for luminosity for a black body, an idealized object which is perfectly opaque and non-reflecting: 

\[ L=\sigma AT^4 \]

The surface area of a sphere with radius r is \( A=4\pi r^2 \), so for stars and other point sources of light:

\[ L= 4\pi\sigma r^2T^4 \]

\subsection{Hubble Deep Field}
The Hubble Deep Field (see Photo \ref{fig:deepfield}) is an image of a small region in the constellation Ursa Major, constructed from a series of observations by \textbf{the Hubble Space Telescope}.

\end{figure}

The field is so small that only a few foreground stars in the Milky Way lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are \underline{galaxies} . By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become \textbf{a landmark image in the study of the early universe}.


\subsection{Stellar classification}
One example of a classification of stars is Harvard spectral classification (see Table \ref{tab:starclass}).

\subsection{Circumpolar stars}
A circumpolar star is a star, as viewed from a given latitude on Earth, that never sets below the horizon due to its apparent proximity to one of the celestial poles.

The northern circumpolar constellations for Poland:
\begin{itemize}[label=$\star$]
    \item Cepheus 
    \item Cassiopeia 
    \item Ursa Minor
    \item Draco
    \item Ursa Major
    \item Camelopardalis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Planets of the Solar System}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mercury
    \item Venus
    \item Earth
    \item Mars
    \item Jupiter
    \item Saturn
    \item Uranus
    \item Neptune
\end{enumerate}
