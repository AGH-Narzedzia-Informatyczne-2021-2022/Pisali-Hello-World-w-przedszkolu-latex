\subsection{Pizza}
Let's suppose that a pizza has a radius equal z and height equal a. Then it's volume (V) is equal to:
\[V=Pi*z*z*a\]

\subsection{Random facts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[!] The gap between two upper front teeth is called diastema.
    \item[!] The grey whale is not really grey. It's black.
    \item[!] There is a Historical Museum of Spaghetti in Pontedassio, Italy.

\subsection{Striped cats}
Among the 19 pairs of chromosomes owned by every cat, there are 18 pairs called the autosomal chromosome and a pair of sex chromosomes. \textbf{Half of the sex chromosome pair is obtained from the male and the other half from the mother}. So a male cat will have 18 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes \textbf{(X and Y; usually denoted XY)}, while a female cat has 18 pairs of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes \textbf{(X and X; denoted as XX)}.

The information about what color a cat will be is stored in the X sex chromosome. \textbf{Since female cats have two of them, if the colors on the chromosomes are not the same, \emph{the cat will be striped}} (see Figure~\ref{fig:cat}). On the other hand, \textbf{male cats have only one x sex chromosome} so there is only one color coded into their DNA and the cat will almost always have that color. In conclusion, \textbf{there are no striped male cats}.
