\subsection{Humans' best friends}
The Labrador Retriever, often abbreviated to \emph{Labrador} or \emph{"Lab"}, is a breed of retriever gun dog from the United Kingdom that was developed from imported Canadian fishing dogs. \textbf{The Labrador is one of the most popular dog breeds in a number of countries in the world}, particularly in the Western world.

A popular disability assistance breed in many countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid those with blindness or autism, act as a therapy dog, or perform screening and detection work for law enforcement and other official agencies. The breed is best known for their \underline{obedience}, \underline{loyalty}, and \underline{playful composure}. Additionally, they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs. Ancestors include a breed used in Newfoundland as fishing dogs, that would help in bringing in the fishing nets and recapture escaped fish.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[--] chocolate 
    \item[--] yellow
    \item[--] black
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Get to know them better!}
When they compared the dog DNA data to information from humans, the researchers came up with a new equation to figure out the dog's comparable human age. The equation: 
\[16ln(dogage) + 31 = humanage.\]

In fact, doggos size also matters, as shown down there:

Table~\ref{table:doggos_years} implicates that Labradors (example: photo~\ref{fig:tobi}) live shorter than other, smaller breeds.
